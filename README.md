# IPL-Match-Bidding-App
The "IPL Match Bidding App - Pie-in-the-Sky" is like a smart tool that uses computer code (SQL) to dig into the heaps of data from Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. It's not just about who wins or loses; it looks at different aspects like how well bidders are doing, which stadiums are popular, and even how winning the toss affects the game. The goal is to help people in IPL, like teams and bidders, make better decisions based on data.

For example, it calculates the percentage of wins for each bidder, giving a detailed look at their success. It also explores which stadiums are busier and how winning the toss can be important in different stadiums. The app doesn't stop at just match numbers â€“ it also looks at teams' overall performance, like how many matches they played, won, and lost. In the business of IPL, where every decision counts, this app is like a handy assistant that turns heaps of numbers into useful insights for better planning and strategy.
